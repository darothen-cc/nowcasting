# Working Notebooks

1. [advection_testing.ipynb] - Test basic NumPy implementations for linear, 2D advection equation solvers versus the comprehensive solutions available via `ClawPack` using idealized test fields
2. [rainfall_observations.ipynb] - A basic analysis of grid-cell rainfall timeseries derived from n0q for a squall line test case in Boston on November 3, 2017
3. [advect_rain.ipynb] - Supplement [advection_testing.ipynb] by applying some of these algorithms to real data derived from n0q.
